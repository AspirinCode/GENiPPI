# GENiPPI

**Interface-aware molecular generative framework for protein-protein interaction modulators**

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in numerous biochemical and biological processes. Although several structure-based molecular generative models have been developed, PPI interfaces and compounds targeting PPIs exhibit distinct physicochemical properties compared to traditional binding pockets and small-molecule drugs. As a result, generating compounds that effectively target PPIs, particularly by considering PPI complexes or interface hotspot residues, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of PPI interfaces with active and inactive compound pairs. Based on this, we propose a novel molecular generative framework tailored to PPI interfaces, named GENiPPI. Our evaluation demonstrates that GENiPPI captures the implicit relationships between the PPI interfaces and the active molecules, and can generate novel compounds that target these interfaces. Moreover, GENiPPI can generate structurally diverse novel compounds with limited PPI interface modulators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration of a structure-based molecular generative model focused on PPI interfaces, which could facilitate the design of PPI modulators. The PPI interface-based molecular generative model enriches the existing landscape of structure-based (pocket/interface) molecular generative model.

## Model Metrics
### MOSES
Molecular Sets (MOSES), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. MOSES implements several popular molecular generation models and provides a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated molecules. With MOSES, MOSES aim to standardize the research on molecular generation and facilitate the sharing and comparison of new models.
