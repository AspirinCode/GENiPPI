# GENiPPI

**Interface-aware molecular generative framework for protein-protein interaction modulators**

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in many biochemical processes and biological processes. Recently, many structure-based molecular generative models have been proposed. However, PPI sites and compounds targeting PPIs have distinguished physicochemical properties compared to traditional binding pockets and drugs, it is still a challenging task to generate compounds targeting PPIs by considering PPI complexes or interface hotspot residues. In this work, we propose a specifically molecular generative framework based on PPI interfaces, named GENiPPI. We evaluated the framework and found it can capture the implicit relationship between the PPI interface and the active molecules, and can generate novel compounds that target the PPI interface. Furthermore, the framework is able to generate diverse novel compounds with limited PPI interface inhibitors. The results show that PPI interface-based molecular generative model enriches structure-based molecular generative models and facilitates the design of modulators based on PPI structures.

## Model Metrics
### MOSES
Molecular Sets (MOSES), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. MOSES implements several popular molecular generation models and provides a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated molecules. With MOSES, MOSES aim to standardize the research on molecular generation and facilitate the sharing and comparison of new models.
