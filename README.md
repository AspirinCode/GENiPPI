# GENiPPI
## Molecular generative framework for protein-protein interface inhibitors
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a vital role in many biochemical processes and life processes. Because abnormal PPIs are associated with various diseases, the regulation of protein-protein interactions is of potential clinical significance. PPIs sites and their compounds targeting PPIs have very different physicochemical properties compared to traditional binding pockets and drugs, which makes targeting PPIs highly challenging. The generative artificial intelligence(AI)-based models can generate novel molecules with the desired properties. Although many excellent structure-based molecular generation models have been proposed, molecular generative models that consider structural features of protein-protein complexes or interface hotspot residues are still missing. Here we propose the conditional molecular generation based on protein-protein interaction(PPI) interface (GENiPPI) method, that can integrate graph attention networks(GATs) and long short-term memory(LSTM) through conditional wasserstein generative adversarial networks(cWGAN). A conditional WGAN was used to train molecular generation models by efficiently learning the relationship between PPI interface with active/inactive molecules. As demonstrated by the condition evaluation, GENiPPI is an effective architecture that captures the implicit relationship between the PPI interface and the active molecule. Applied to BAZ2B (bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2B)-H4 target protein, we further filtered the generated molecules by machine learning based dual classifier and physically driven simulations for validation.

```

## Model Metrics
Molecular Sets (MOSES), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. MOSES implements several popular molecular generation models and provides a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated molecules. With MOSES, MOSES aim to standardize the research on molecular generation and facilitate the sharing and comparison of new models.
